# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Analysis Overview
Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
We are helping the organization understand how many people will likely be retiring over the next few years.  We are also being asked to idenfity how many employees could realistically be trained to take the place of many of those people who are retiting.  The Pewlett-Hackard organization would like to understand just how many people, and in which roles they will need to hire external talent and/or train current employees.

## Results

When we look at the breakdown of people leaving by title vs. the mentorship eligible employees by title - there will be a big gap that will have to be filled by external hires.

Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

There are many retirement-ready people who could train the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees, but new hires would have to happen quickly to ensure there is time for the close to retirement employees have the time to properly train current PH employees as well as new hires that must occur to fill the impending gaps.  There are however not enough mentorship-eligible employees if PH limits this program to only those born in 1965, they may want to expand to include younger employees to ensure more knowledge transfer can happen before the huge wave of retirement.
