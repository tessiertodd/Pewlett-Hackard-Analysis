# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Analysis Overview
We are helping the organization understand how many people will likely be retiring over the next few years.  We are also being asked to idenfity how many employees could realistically be trained to take the place of many of those people who are retiting.  The Pewlett-Hackard organization would like to understand just how many people, and in which roles they will need to hire external talent and/or train current employees.  We have also been asked to identify how many people by title would be eligible for a mentorship program.

## Results

- Pewlett-Hackard will be losing 90,398 people over the next few years based on looking at employees born from 1952 to 1955.

## Summary

There will need to be 90,398 roles filled over the next few years as those who are eligible take their retirement... with 1,549 current employees eligible for mentorships, that would mean that PH would have to go external to hire 88,849 people.

When we look at the breakdown of people close to retirement by title vs. the mentorship eligible employees - there will be a big gap that will have to be filled by external hires or headcount would have to be reduced (of course other challenges with that).

There are many retirement-ready people who could train the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees, but new hires would have to happen quickly to ensure there is time for the close to retirement employees have the time to properly train current PH employees as well as new hires that must occur to fill the impending gaps.  There are however not enough mentorship-eligible employees if PH limits this program to only those born in 1965, they may want to expand to include younger employees to ensure more knowledge transfer can happen before the huge wave of retirement.
